## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What tags are necessary for a complete HTML Skeleton?
  You need a 'DOCTYPE' tag, 'html' tag, and a 'body' tag. There are other tags, like 'title' or 'p' or 'a', but for a basic skeleton, I believe only the first three I mentioned are necessary.

- What type of content belongs within the `<head>` of an HTML document?
  The head contains all the metadata, i.e. information that is useful to you and identifying what the document is, but not info that you want the user to see.

- What type of content belongs within the `<body>` of an HTML document?
  Everything you want to appear on the page to the user.

- Where must the `DOCTYPE` declaration appear in a valid HTML document?
  At the very top of the document
